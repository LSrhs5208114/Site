<p>Your bus came very late this morning. You and the other students on your bus had to sign in at the front office. After you've signed in, you walk haalf-way to class before yo realize you forgot your History homeowork, and your grade in that class is already starting to dip. The homework was to watch a video and write notes on what you watched. You did the homework and left it on your desk in your room.</p>
