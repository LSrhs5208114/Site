      <h1 style="font-size:155%">I belive that Honesty, Respect, Courage, Compassion, and Responsibility are needed for perfect citizenship.</h1>
      <h2 style="font-size:100%">And one more core value, as well as one good thing I did recently that is good citizenship, with proof of course.</h2>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">Honesty is being truthful. An example of this is if you do something bad, you own up to it instead of lying or putting the blame on others. This is needed for citizenship so people feel that they can trust others in the real world as well as the virtual one.</p>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">Respect is also required for someone to be a good citizen within their community, wether it be online or in their household. Respect is when someone treats someone well, no matter their race, grender, age, or almost any other condition. This is necessary for people to enjoy their time in life.</p>

        <p style="font-size:95%;">Resposibility is a necessary characteristic for good citizenship. Resposibility is defined as having an obligation and fulfilling it properly. An example of responisbility is by following all the rules that are set.</p>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">Compassion is defined as "a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering."<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/compassion?s=t"</a>https://www.dictionary.com/browse/compassion?s=t</a> This means that, for example, if someone where to be bullied, instead of doing nothing, you be kind and COMPASSIONITE towards them. This is another important part of being a good citizen.</p>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">The second to last thing that I belive is required for good citizenship is courage. You must have courage to try new things, you must have courage to help others, you must have courage to stand up to and for others and to think for yourself, and you must have courage to ask for help and do not be ashamed if you must.</p>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">The final part of having good citizenship is being happy. It can help you out in many ways. It could also help other people feel happy, not just for others, but for themselves as well. It could go a great deal in improving your community.</p>
        <p style="font-size:95%;">The most recent act of good citizenship that I have preformed would be helping someone in finding their lost pencil case, and offering to let them go to soccer practice while I searched for it myself. This is an act of good citizenship because it follows two of the core values of good citizenship. Those core values would be Compassion and Resposibility, compassion because I was kind and caring and willing to help out, which also follows courage, seeing as I would not have made and conversation with the person as they were not part of my small circle of friends, and it also followed the value of resposibility because I made it my resposibility to help that person find their pencil case.</p>
